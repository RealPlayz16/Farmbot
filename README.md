1) Idea
   
Farmers are the cornerstone of the Indian economy; ideally, they should have the best resources. Yet, for farmers, the task of cultivating healthy crops is fraught with challenges, one of the most significant being the lack of precise methods to monitor and manage agricultural needs. Inconsistent measurements for soil health, moisture levels, and other critical factors often lead to wasted resources and reduced yields. Our goal was to create a project that, on a small and achievable scale, addresses this issue by empowering farmers with tools to make informed decisions, ultimately contributing to sustained greenery and agricultural success.

2) Problem Statement
   
Farmers face significant challenges in maintaining consistent soil moisture levels, which are critical for plant growth. Manual monitoring is labor-intensive, and over-irrigation or under-irrigation can lead to reduced crop yields and wastage of resources. The lack of accessible, affordable, and automated solutions further exacerbates this issue, particularly for small-scale farmers.  

3) SDGs in play
   
SDG 15 -- Life on land
SDG 13 -- Climate Actions

4) Constraints
   
a) Power Supply Limitations: Ensuring a reliable and portable power source to sustain the device’s operations, especially in remote farming areas with limited access to electricity.

b) Material Durability: The PVC chassis and 3D-printed body must withstand environmental factors such as moisture, temperature changes, and potential mechanical stress in the field.

c) Sensor Accuracy: Soil moisture sensors must provide precise and consistent readings, which may vary due to soil type, composition, and environmental conditions.

d) Maintenance Requirements: The mechanism for dipping the sensor and cleaning it needs to be robust, requiring minimal maintenance and preventing sensor wear over time.

e) Ease of Assembly and Repair: The design should allow for easy assembly and repair, enabling farmers or technicians to address issues without specialized tools or skills.

f) Environmental Compatibility: The materials and operation should be environmentally friendly, ensuring that the device does not contribute to soil contamination or excessive energy consumption.

5) Solutions Brainstorming
   
While brainstorming this idea, we aimed to create a practical solution that addresses a real challenge farmers face—data analysis for the best effective yield for the plants. We wanted to create a device that combined simplicity with functionality, leveraging PVC pipes for a lightweight yet sturdy chassis and a 3D-printed body for customization and durability. We focused on developing a mechanism for the soil moisture sensor to dip into the soil, try to self-clean, and repeat the process. The goal was to design something affordable, easy to assemble, and reliable in tough agricultural environments. This process required balancing creativity with practicality, ensuring the idea was both innovative and achievable.

6) Final Solution

Name of the project- Farmbot

As a compound word from Farmer's and Robot, as it resembles a machine capable of finding exact data for the farmer's benefit. 

7) Design process

Our design emphasizes a lightweight and durable chassis made from PVC pipes, providing a cost-effective and versatile framework for the device. Complementing the chassis is a 3D-printed body, allowing for intricate and customizable features. The soil moisture sensor is strategically mounted at the base, ensuring optimal contact with the soil during operation. The 3D-printed structure not only houses and protects the controllers and circuitry but also includes a designated compartment for cable management, ensuring both functionality and aesthetic appeal. This combination of PVC and 3D-printed materials enhances the device's durability and accessibility while keeping it lightweight and visually appealing.

9) Skills used

This project involved a blend of technical and creative skills. Mechanical design skills were crucial for planning and assembling the PVC pipe chassis and creating the 3D-printed body. Electronics and circuit design skills were applied to integrate the soil moisture sensor, motor drivers, and microcontroller. Programming skills were used to write and debug the code for automating the sensor's dipping and cleaning mechanism. Additionally, 3D modelling and printing expertise ensured the precise fabrication of custom components. Problem-solving and brainstorming were key to overcoming design constraints, while teamwork and effective communication helped in collaboratively refining the project.

10) Challenges faced and solutions

One of the biggest challenges was designing a mechanism that allowed the soil moisture sensor to dip into the soil, clean itself, and repeat the cycle reliably. Initial designs were either too complex or prone to mechanical failure, requiring several iterations before achieving a robust solution.

Another hurdle was ensuring the PVC pipe chassis was lightweight yet sturdy enough to support the device’s components. Aligning the 3D-printed parts with the PVC frame posed precision challenges during assembly.

Programming the microcontroller was also a test of patience, as unexpected bugs disrupted the automation process, particularly in synchronizing the dipping and cleaning functions. Additionally, sourcing durable yet affordable materials while staying within the budget was a significant constraint.
